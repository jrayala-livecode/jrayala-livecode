### About Me

Software developer focused on building clean, modern, and efficient internal tools using technologies like Vue, Laravel, FastAPI, Electron, and Python. I lead small teams and handle everything from backend architecture to frontend UX, always aiming for clarity, maintainability, and speed. Most of my work involves streamlining processes, automating bottlenecks, and integrating AI when it makes sense. Feel free to hit me up.
