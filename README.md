### About Me

I'm a Software Developer with varying experience in high-level programming languages (yeah, no C++ here).
As much as I love coding there's still a lot that I want and need to learn. Anyways feel free to check my code,
most of it is not in production or was used to document learning processes so it doesn't reflect my current skills.
